## About OpenCV
[OpenCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally      developed by Intel's research center in Nizhny Novgorod (Russia), it was later supported by Willow Garage and is now maintained by Itseez.The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.

   Detects and displays only red coloured objects from the video feed. 

2. [Hand Gesture Recognition(Counting fingers)](https://github.com/Poirot1729/Open-CV/tree/master/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition)
   
   A naive implementation of contour defects to find the number of fingers raised within an ROI in the video feed. 

3. [Document Scanner](https://github.com/Poirot1729/Open-CV/tree/master/Document%20Scanner)
   
   A document scanner which isolates a document in an image and gives it a scanned effect

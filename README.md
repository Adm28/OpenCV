# Projects using OpenCV Python library
  This is a collection of basic OpenCv projects I made. All the codes are written by me. Contributions or help is most welcome.
## Projects till now
1. [Colour detection](https://github.com/Poirot1729/Open-CV/tree/master/Color%20Detection)
   
   Detects and displays only red coloured objects from the video feed. 

2. [Hand Gesture Recognition(Counting fingers)](https://github.com/Poirot1729/Open-CV/tree/master/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition)
   
   A naive implementation of contour defects to find the number of fingers raised within an ROI in the video feed. 

3. [Document Scanner](https://github.com/Poirot1729/Open-CV/tree/master/Document%20Scanner)
   
   A document scanner which isolates a document in an image and gives it a scanned effect

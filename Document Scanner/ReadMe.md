# Document Scanner
I found this project on [pyimagesearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/?__s=qfesvtpzzekgnpu4vorc) and tried to do it on my own. I could only manage so far. Help to make this better is welcome. :)

## Requirements
* Python 2.x
* Opencv library

## Issues
- [ ] Quality of final image
- [ ] Warping algorithm not tested
